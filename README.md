# book-store-react
This project will lay foundations for your Bookstore website. I will create a React and Redux app. I'll structure my files using the "feature folder" approach. I will also set up routing using React Router.I will create an MVP version of Awesome-Bookstore project that allows us to:

Display a list of books.
Add a book.
Remove a selected book.
